# "Lady Macbeth"

Your typical data cleansing project, CSV and bad URI variety. Though nothing, will drive them away. Bad URIs are here to stay:(

This repo is only useful to myself and one colleague. To liven things up - anything with the terms "csv" and "URI" drive me nuts - we used some fun variable names, and hence the repo's title ;)
